👋 Hello, I'm Carelle, and I dream of being an engineer in the technology space.

🖥️ Recently, I completed a Bachelor of Information Technology with a 3.9/4 GPA.

📚 Previously, I completed a Bachelor of Business (Marketing).

📷 For the past decade, I've worked in marketing, graphic design, photography, video production and motion graphics.

💥 In my professional career, I've had the opportunity to build apps with developers and on my own. This hands-on experience is what first sparked my interest in this area.

💖 I find solving complex problems fulfilling as it allows me to push the boundaries of my creativity and technical expertise. You know that feeling when you're so engrossed in something that time seems to fly by? That's how I feel when I'm designing, developing and testing technical solutions.

🎯 My goal is to secure a position that fuels my thirst for knowledge and lets me dive deeper into the ever-evolving world of IT.
