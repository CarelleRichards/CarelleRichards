👋 Hello, I'm Carelle, and I dream of being a software engineer.

🖥️ Recently, I completed a Bachelor of Information Technology with a 3.9/4 GPA.

📚 Previously, I completed a Bachelor of Business (Marketing).

📷 For the past decade, I've worked in marketing, graphic design, photography, video production and motion graphics.

💥 In my professional career, I've had the opportunity to build apps with developers and on my own. This hands-on experience first sparked my interest in software engineering.

💖 I find software engineering fulfilling as solving complex problems allows me to push the boundaries of my creativity and technical expertise. You know that feeling when you're so engrossed in something that time seems to fly by? That's me when I'm programming.

🎯 I have a soft spot for back end and full stack development, but my real goal is to secure a position that fuels my thirst for knowledge and lets me dive deeper into the ever-evolving world of IT.
